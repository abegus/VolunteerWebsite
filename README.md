# VolunteerWebsite
This is a Website I created for my CS 741 (Software Engineering Principles) Class.  To check out more details, read below, or go to my website at www.agbues.com 

# TECHNOLIGIES USED
asp.net/C# MVC,  MSSQL LocalDB, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, Database First migrations, Entity Framework, Visual Studio 2015

# DESCRIPTION
To create this website, I went through a Software Engineering development lifecycle making documentation along the way (Which I have included in the repository). I began by creating a Functional Requirements document for the Volunteer Website, followed by an Architectural Design document. After this, I created an initial GUI prototype and demonstrated it to my Instructor who was acting on behalf of the client for the project. Once there was feedback on the GUI, I started my Incremental Prototyping. I added different functionalities from my Functional Requirements document to each prototype until I had implemented everything.

# DOCUMENTATION
- Functional Requirements: Includes the problem description, Assumptions for program, User Characteristics, System Characteristics, User Characteristics, Functional Requirements, and Non-functional Requirements
- Architural Diagram:  Shows my proposed Model View Controller achitecture, along with the different modules I used to break up the functional requirements into logical groups.
